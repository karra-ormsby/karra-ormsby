## Hi there, I'm Karra


I am currently looking to change my career into Web Development after over a decade in retail management. I have recently completed a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, and am about to embark in the Victorian Government Digital Jobs Program in Frontend Web Development. In my free time I am working on creating my own TCG ecommerce website.
